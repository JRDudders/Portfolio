# Portfolio

This is my first attempt to create a public portfolio.

Folder Walker, Extenstion Finder, and Pandas Practice were created to solve practical problems in a previous job. N-Grams is a modified assignment from my Intro to NLP course at Georgetown.


Please also see my current reading list for areas where I'm trying to develop my knowledge in my spare time:

# My Reading List

Also, here's what's on my bookshelf to be read when I'm not busy with schoolwork:

Python Machine Learning -Raschka & Mirjalili

Statistics for Linguists: an Introduction Using R -Winter
