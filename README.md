#Portfolio

This is my first attempt to create a public portfolio

Folder Walker, Extenstion Finder, and Pandas Practice were created to solve practical problems in a previous job. N-Grams is a modified assignment from my Intro to NLP course at Georgetown


Please also see my current reading list for areas where I'm trying to grow my knowledge in my spare time.
